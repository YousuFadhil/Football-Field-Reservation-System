IV.	Project Description
The system process will start by registering the user. There are three types of users: admin, owner, and player, who will be able to manage their profiles and ability to recover forgotten passwords.  Each one of the users will have a different control panel that contains different tasks. Admin will be responsible for managing the rest of the users who will be able to view a list of different users, owners, playgrounds, and can even delete an entire user. The owner can add details about his playground like name, location, and price. Also, the owner can view the list of the reservations and confirm the payment process. On the other side, the player will be able to see the list of the football playgrounds with their details such as location and price so he can select the proper one that will lead him to see the available time for that playground on a particular day. After selecting the time and date, it will be saved in the database so that it cannot be chosen again by another player. In the end, the system will generate a reservation bill that will be used by the owner later to confirm the payment process that will be saved to the database so the system will use this data to check if the player pays for the previous reservation or not. If not, the system will not allow for a new reservation on the same player.
